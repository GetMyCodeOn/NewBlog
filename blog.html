										<p>Day One: Blind Leading the Blind</p>
			<p>
				Aporia: We started with a set of introductory lectures outlining the course and its background. So far, nothing different from most courses. 

				However, then we were giving the week’s task - to build a website and blog for our group - and a list of tools that might be helpful. Then nothing, no lecture to introduce these tools, or show how to do it. We struggled and it was frustrating, several of the tools, like github/git and nitrous.io are not straightforward to use and finding information that worked for all of us across our different operating systems. The method, that did not become apparent as a method until day 2, left us floundering in the dark for several hours. Coming from University education that followed a set formula of lecture, seminar, and then essay or exam on what was taught in the previous lectures - this was drastic change. Slowly and in small jerks, one person in the room or group would find out how to do one thing and others would crowd round to learn, whereby the new knowledge spread throughout the class. Still, I left the first day frustrated and feeling that even the extensive pre-course prerequisite courses had left my woefully unprepared for the actualities of coding. 
				</p>
Day Two: We Made a (bad) Website!4>	
				<p>
				Light dawns: I arrived expecting more of the same confusion as reigned yesterday, but together we began to use Github and our HTML skills to build a basic website. The mood in the group and class room was completely different, we still did not know much about coding besides the basics, but I felt positive about the prospect of figuring our the workings of these tools as a group. I will write more about what I think is so valuable about the teaching approach of throwing the students in at the deep end, once I have more experience with it. At the end of the day we built a basic, but working website in HTML and hosted it on the GitHub pages. 
				</p>
Day Three: Jekyll and Hyde
					<p>
					Bootstrappers get bootstrapping: Wednesday was another very productive day. Olivia found some excellent Bootstrap tutorials that gave us a foothold in that area and I felt we progressed from a very basic site to a much nice looking responsive site over the course of the day. The group vernacular, and particularly my own, had changed as well, from “erhhh, git what?” to “Yeah, just add a metatag, link to the bootstrap cdn and then git commit and push”  
					</p>				
Day Four: Hyd-ing Jekyll
				<p>	
				Jekyll appears: By the end of Wednesday we had built the individual pages of our website and made them nice-looking, but we struggled to find a way of combining the different pages into a single webpage where the pages linked to each other. I fell into the trap of comfort. I felt happy about finding a tool - bootstrap - that was straightforward to use and produced nice-looking results; so I hoped to be able to build the site without using other, as of yet unknown tools. Turns out that isn’t possible. The other groups had started with Jekyll, whilst we started on bootstrap. We got nice layout, whilst they built structured sites. Learning from other groups was a great help and really helped. Most of the day was spent learning this tool, but we started to make the site come together by the end of the day. There was a period where the level of confusion was approaching the first day’s, but because the other groups had spent time on Jekyll before us, we were able to break through this plateau much quicker than on day one. 
				 </p>
Day Five: Lets get this Show on the Road

				<p>
				Showdown: Final day of our first project. Everyone was very positive and hard at work on finishing the project in time for the afternoon presentation. I struggled with building a carousel to display snapshots of the different stages of our projects for our portfolio, which sadly I have  to give up to finish up the interlinking of our different pages on the live page. I am amazed at how far we have come in this week. I feel that building this site would not have been possible with a traditional teacher-led course. The constant social pressure and responsibility of team roles and focus on self and group reliance in solving project problems created a very productive environment, that though frustrating, was successful.

										<p>Day One: Blind Leading the Blind
					<p>Sat here wondering how on earth I will get through the next 7-weeks and come out the other end being able to fully get my code on. 16 of us sat in a room that seemed to be embodying the term "blind leading the blind."<p>
Day Two: We Made a (bad) Website!	
					<p>
					Our gits were pushing and pulling and ready to commit our code just simply needed to put together some code, bootstraps and jekyll 
					
					By 4pm we had a working blog yay! The group morale is a lot better and I think we are on track for all the boot strapping and jekylling tomorrow.. stay tuned to find out.</p>
Day Three: Jekyll and Hyde
					
					<p>
					I think this is the best thing I could have done before starting a new chapter in life - starting my own business. Not even because of the technical aspects of the course. It's the way this course is developing and shaping mindsets and attitudes.
					1. Don't give up - the amount if times things don't work but you have to keep trying and keep figuring out ways to do it 
						2. No one will tell you what to do - same with your business - figure it out 
						3. Patience patience patience 
						4. Don't reinvent the wheel - people have been coding for years- if you can copy their code do it - Greg from sparroh. People have been setting up businesses for years and there is a lot of best practice out there- learn from the best because somewhere somehow someone has done what you want to do in some shape or form!
						Really, not matter what you want to do next in life, this course is for you!</p>
Day Four: Hyd-ing Jekyll
									
				<p>Your environment dictates your work ethic. 
				If feel like the stupidest in the class, good. It means you can only become better. If you're the cleverest in the class, you are your own benchmark. The environment at founders and coders is that no one wants to give up when faced with a challenge And it's helping me develop the same mindset.
				This is the best place to be as a graduate, wantrepreneur, entrepreneur or anything else</p>

										<p>Day One: Blind Leading the Blind<
			<p>
				Extremely overwhelming but looking back it was a great way to get to see the whole team function in a pressure situation. It felt like going from baby steps into a full sprint. I think it set the tone and since then we’ve really grown as a group. We came up with our team name #getmycodeon and set up the foundations that we’ve been building on ever since.</p>
Day Two: We Made a (bad) Website!	
				<p>
				Managed to construct the skeleton of our blog but lacking the beauty elements of CSS. We divided the topics up and did individual research in order to cover a broad swathe of information. As the Presenter I found it challenging to get to grips with everything the group had accomplished and relay that back to the class. </p>
Day Three: Jekyll and Hyde
					<p>
					Struggling to get to grips with Jekyll we opted to dive headlong into Twitter Bootstrap and found some really great functions that we applied to the site. Having a great deal to offer the class come the presentation, it was on day three that I really began to feel that we were picking up pace and combining our strengths as a team to a single end.  </p>
Day Four: Hyd-ing Jekyll
				<p>
				On Day Four our we maintained the velocity established the day before, surging ahead with progress on the site. Deciding to take a page each, I focused on our Blog’s Social Media page, inserting widgets for Twitter, Instagram and Vine. Although separately our pages looked great, we failed in linking all four together. This meant that although aesthetically our blog looked fantastic, in terms of functionality it was somewhat lacking.</p>
Day Five: Lets get this Show on the Road
				<p>
				After linking our pages in the morning – after a minor adjustment – we set about climbing the Jekyll mountain in front of us. We found, however, that it was a) not as difficult as we had first thought and b) not particularly necessary given that we had already created a functional website. We ended the week on a high looking forward to the next project. </p></p>

										<p>Day One: Blind Leading the Blind
			<p>
				First day at Founders and Coders! We were thrown right in at the deep end and asked to create a blog site by the end of the week! Initially, we were split into teams of four with each member taking on a role for the week, mine being the tutor. Team #GetMyCodeOn was born! Firstly, we had to set up our development (dev) environments and create a repository on github, which would become our blogsite. I spent the rest of the day along with my team members attempting to get to grips with all the commands git pull/git commit etc. After a frustrating day of error line after error line we finally managed to set up an organisation team page on git hub and created our first repository!</p>
Day Two: We Made a (bad) Website!
				<p>I started off the day making myself familiar with the terminal on my laptop and all the different features it could do. Just before lunch, as my role as tutor, I gave a quick demo of my development environment and some of the exciting features I had discovered on my command line. 
					In the afternoon we began to create the bare bones of our website using HTML and CSS. Once this had been made we became to play around with Twitter Bootstrap, and Jekyll, two front-end frameworks for styling sites.</p>
Day Three: Jekyll and Hyde
					<p>
					I began the day by watching a series of tutorials on twitter bootstrap and working through them to create a more functional and visually appealing site page. Just before lunch I gave a tutorial on how to make a button on your webpage that links to a website (see tutorial here), something I had just learnt that morning! By that afternoon, as a team, we had created five functional pages using twitter bootstrap that looked great! We then began to experiment with Jekyll which proved frustrating, the styling didn't seem to be very compatible with the bootstrap styling we had used and the result wasn't great. </p>
Day Four: Hyd-ing Jekyll
				<p>	
				After struggling with Jekyll some more, I decided to ditch it in favour of twitter bootstrap and just focus on making the pages functional and look nice. I began to play around with some of the features of twitter bootstrap and gave a tutorial on the grid system and the how websites built with twitter bootstrap are scalable so can be viewed on any sized device easily (check it out on your phone!).  Towards the end of the day we began the arduous process of linking our five pages together to create our blog in time for the deadline tomorrow. Try as we might, we were unable to link them together without seeing a 404 error and left in the evening feeling rather dejected. </p>
Day Five: Lets get this Show on the Road

				<p>Poised with a fresh, optimistic attitude we attempted to tackle our linking problem and successfully managed to link our five pages before 10 am! Huzzah! Now that we had a webpage which linked successfully (ish) to the other pages, we were able to focus on the content of the page and add in some new features. I gave a tutorial on using links within a webpage to navigate to different sections and began to build a navigation bar in the blog page. At the end of the first week we had successfully created a functional webpage! Go team #GetmyCodeOn! </p></p>

										Day Six: Client Side Developer Challenge</a></h4>
					<p>
					Confidence: Today started in the opposite way to last week: we were given the challenge to build a widget that would pull content from the Guardian API and display the results from Football, UK News, and Travel in different tabs. The brief included building the site responsive and mobile first. I felt extremely confident about this brief and we got started quickly on building the basic layout. Very confidently I predicted we would be finished by Wednesday, well in advance of the code assessment by the Guardian’s Stephan Fowler. 

					</p>
Day Seven: AJAX/JSON/JSONP/API/JS
				<p>
				Hubris: Yep, wildly underestimated the difficulty of the task. As the morning progressed and none of us had found a way of pulling content from the Guardian API - the core of our project - and no clear way to progress, the confusion of week 1 entered into week 2. It appeared to me as though all the other groups had figured it out and I felt horribly behind. However, after meeting the other project managers it became clear that the other groups were in a similar position to us. We spent most of the day blindly searching for tutorials and guides on google. 

				</p>
Day Eight: DNRY

				<p>
				Steal, then understand: Today was a revelation in that we found a solution to the data fetching problem. Jack was great at implementing and tweaking it to our needs. I got too caught up in the other tasks instead of sitting down and properly understanding how the AJAX called actually work. This was a hinderance in our code evaluations and going forward I will strive to always understand all of our code when we implement it and not later.  
				</p>
Day Nine: Show Time!
				<p>
				Judgement Day: Our big day is here, at five Stephan Fowler of the Guardian is coming to asses our widget. We have the functionality working, but it looks terrible. At two, we find out that our tabs, written in CSS3 does not work in IE9 - which the brief states the widget has to be compatible with. Until the presentation we work at full blast to get the MVP ready. 
				</p>
Day Ten: Minor Tweaks</a></h4>
				<p>Putting the house in order: I feel relaxed today, the presentation went well yesterday. I spend most of the day tidying up our backlog on Pivotal tracker and setting down with the group going through our code, line by line. The mood is good and we get to know each other better over pizza in the garden, courtesy of the first official GetMyCodeOn expedition to the outside world! The sunshine hurt our eyes and harmed our progressing developer complexions after two weeks in our coding lair.

										<p>Day Six: Client Side Developer Challenge
					<p>
					Client side developer challenge this week! This week I am the presenter aka. the project managers right hand woman. Its my role to ensure that we have some sort of working code by 4pm everyday to present back to the rest of the class. Today was a day of googling all the terms that we were unfamiliar with in our brief, AJAX, asynchronous data fetching, JSON..?  We began to develop an idea of what we would be doing but how we would be doing it would take another days work… 

					</p>
Day Seven: AJAX/JSON/JSONP/API/JS
				<p>
					The team tried to work through how to write the code to meet the brief. A good thing about this course is that everyone is up for helping everyone. We roped in other teams to help us understand more about how to approach the task and by the end of the day had working code to present. 

				</p>
Day Eight: DNRY

				<p>
				Crunch time was getting closer - Stephan Fowler will be coming in tomorrow to review each teams work. I could feel the added layer of stress in the room as we were working to an external deadline. 
				</p>
Day Nine: Show Time! 
				<p>
				Stephan would be coming at 5! We spent the day refining our code and making sure that we were adhering to the style guide. I worked on trying to get to grips with all the code so I would be able to present it back. We were the first team up and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. In Stephans words "I have very little to critique." The feedback across all teams was very positive and we all felt proud presenting our final work.
				</p>
Day Ten: Minor Tweaks
				<p>Wrap up - This week was a lot harder than the last, It was a lot more technical and less design work. I struggled a lot however, it was good to see everyone coming together to solve the problem. 

				We created a widget which sourced data from the Guardians website for News, Travel and Sport using an application programming interface. We made a desktop version which was also mobile compatible and began to think about progressive enhancement and graceful degradation when creating applications.</p>

										<p>Day Six: Client Side Developer Challenge
					<p>
					Starting a new week and changing roles within the group, I became the Tutor. Our new project was to create a tabs page for The Guardian that would be a client-side, mobile-first development. I attempted to teach the class about the difference between synchronous and asynchronous data fetching, and although it was by no means a comprehensive overview I think that it was a valuable lesson in the basics of the asynchronous method of data collecting that would form the basis of Week Two’s task.</p>
Day Seven: AJAX/JSON/JSONP/API/JS
				<p>
				Dividing the work by gender and brand of laptop Aske and I tackled the problem of fetching data from The Guardian’s API. Looking back it seemed like an impossible task, however we tackled it head on now our tabs function works really well. Admittedly we did have some help from other groups, most notably Digital Alchemy, however the fact that we can all understand and use API’s is testament to the student led approach of Founders and Coders.</p>
Day Eight: DNRY
				<p>
				We attempted to design the tabs in HTML is order to achieve graceful degradation for those users with ‘lesser’ browsers which did not support the JavaScript we used to pull from the API. We managed to fetch a very basic string of data from The Guardian website on the morning of Day Eight, and by the afternoon had also managed to gain access to the trail text, images and short Urls. We did not, however, manage to organise this data in an aesthetically pleasing way. </p>
Day Nine: Show Time! 
				<p>
				Day Nine was the day of our big review and so in the hours before our presentation to Stephen Fowler at 17:00 we were engaged in a mad whirlwind of activity. Tidying up our code and tweaking our tabs and images took us right up to the wire, but we managed to get everything finished in time and were first to present. AND IT WENT DOWN A TREAT!!! Although perhaps we received an unfair amount of praise due to presenting first, it was agreed that we had fulfilled all of the criteria of the brief and perhaps you will see team #getmycodeon working with The Guardian’s front-end developer team at some point in the future!</p>
Day Ten: Minor Tweaks
				<p>
				The end of our second week was a relaxing one as, having successfully presented our work the day before, we spent our time ironing out the creases and working on Stephens recommendations. As one of the Tutors I presented to the class an idea for establishing a class-wide code convention. I thought this would make reviewing and using each others’ code an easier task.

					<p>To start off the second week we were given the challenge of creating a mobile-first app that pulls the latest news from the Guardian website asynchronously from the Guardian API. The day kicked off with an en-mass google search of APIs and asynchronous data fetching…by lunch, the concept appeared to make sense in our minds but the problem arose with how we were actually going to create code that did what we wanted to do! As we were all relatively unfamiliar with javascript it felt like a tall order. 

					For my role as journalist this week I began playing around with vine and instagram to document our progress...
							</p>
Day Seven: AJAX/JSON/JSONP/API/JS
				<p>
				The day began again with yet more Internet searching for tutorials on a wide variety of confusing acronyms. AJAX, JSON and JSONP were the words 'du jour' but I was none the wiser as to what they actually meant, stood for or how they could be used to fetch our content. 

				By lunch, other teams appeared to have created a piece of code that could fetch data in the way we wanted so after a bit of shameless plagiarisation we finished the day with basic functioning code that could pull the latest content on news, football and travel and input them into three separately labelled tabs. 
				</p>
Day Eight: DNRY
			<p>
			As the task was to create a mobile first component, we focused on shortening the javascript code based on a further acronym DNRY-Do Not Repeat Yourself! We also worked on creating an attractive tabbed layout using javascript and also using the noscript code to flash up a warning message if the did does not have javascript enabled. </p>
Day Nine: Show Time! 
				<p>
				By the end of the day our app was to be scrutinised by Stephen Fowler of the Guardian! Most of the day was focused on creating the most succinct javascript code possible and creating a functioning mobile-first app that looked good on a phone and ran quickly. Things got a bit hectic but there was still time to make a quick vine introducing team #getmycodeon and we finally got our website up and running on our domain name. 
				</p>
Day Ten: Minor Tweaks
				<p>The feedback from Stephen Fowler was really positive and with only a few changes to make we got to work in the morning to create our final product! 
				It had been a technically very challenging week with a large amount of javascript fundamentals to cover but together as a team we pulled together to learn a really useful bit of code!

										<p>Day 11 - Changing approach
					<p>
				On Day Eleven we started a new project based around node.js and WOW was it difficult! I am sure, however, that as with the other mountainous tasks we have scaled so far we will surely reach the summit before Friday. 
					</p>
Day 12 - Tough going
				<p>
			Nodeschool.js was by far the hardest week so far. Attempting to learn node without a working knowledge of JavaScript was the biggest challenge and we decided as a class to postpone Week Three’s project and buckle down to learn node. 

				</p>
Day 13 - Learnyounode</a></h4>

				<p>
			As a class we tackled node school together, using a random selector to choose individuals to present to the class on specific topics. In this way we moved away from the group based approach of the initial two weeks and towards a more traditional classroom learning structure. 
  
				</p>
Day 14 - The damned sixes
				
				<p>
				Having moved through the nodeschool challenges there was a noticeable difference within the class of ability to understand the tasks. On Day Fourteen we differed our approach slightly to make sure that everyone was moving at the same speed. This saw class-members who were more proficient with nodeschool take a step back from their own learning to assist the members of the group who were slightly behind. By the end of the day as a class we had all finished the nodeschool exercises and had managed to achieve a good understanding of what it would take to complete Week Three’s project.

				</p>
Day 15 - Nodeschool out
				<p>
			Having finished nodeschool we spent Day Fifteen dividing the tasks required for the completion of the project. We managed to extract some data from the Twitter API and although we could not access the specific information needed – i.e. the posted image urls – it was a great success to be able to write some working back-end code.

The hardest part was trying to discipline yourself mentally to keep trying even though you can't understand what is going on and everyone seems to be ovine forward.

Day 12 - Tough going

				Today there seemed to be a natural progression for some however for me and other members it still made no sense. Again it was hard to maintain focus as I still had not got to grips with what we were doing yesterday. But Dan assured us that we will all make it to the end! 

				He also did say that this week would be the hardest week which bought some relief, kind of.

				Still feeling lost and some what demotivated me and Jack teamed together to start again from the start. We were very behind (a whole two days behind), but it didn't make sense to carry on blindly. I felt like that 'special' child in the class who needed extra assistance. 

				Dan still assured us we will make it!

Day 14 - The damned sixes

				Me and Jack were still behind but decided to join the rest of the class again. We were on a tight schedule with hourly slots to work on each problem and then Dan would pick a name out the hat to present the problem. Things started to make sense and it was very endearing to see how we were all working together to explain the content, filling in the gaps of each other and making sure everyone was on the same page.

Day 15 - Nodeschool out
				<p>
				It finally makes sense, kind of! After a painful week of node school things started to click. We worked through the rest of the node school exercises. I found myself being able to explain some of the stuff that we had been going through, I didn't even know I knew it! I guess something had been going in this last week. 

				This week was a week of frustration to say the least. Words from Dan - Part of being a developer is being able to work through the feeling of "I'm dumb I don't get it." That was definitely the feeling of this week. More then ever this course is developing mental resilience when faced with challenges!</p></p>

										<p><p>Day 16
	Carrying on from last week on node.js we are going to be working on the project. My role for 	this week is tutor, where I deliver daily tutorials to the rest of the class. Todays was one 	Functions which you can read about on here (insert link). </p>

<p>Day 17
	Trying to do the project while still trying to understand node.js proved to be a hard task. We created a project plan to split the project into smaller components and got on with it!</p>

<p>Day 18
	Today was again a day of frustration, little progress was made and talking to the other teams everyone felt the same, which always helps!</p>
<p>Day 19
	Nearing the end of week 4 but our project looks no way near finished. Hoping to pull things together tomorrow. </p>

<p>Day 20
	Code review at 5pm where everyone presents their work. The results proved that the week had been a struggle as only BteamFC were able to get a final product together! See their valiant effort here (link). This week really battered the teams confidence, hopefully next week will be better!</p></p>

										<p>Day 16: Following on from last week’s challenge, we started the day attempting to figure out how we were going to build our server in node.js to pull in data from twitter and store the images in json format. We then had to use front end javascript to link the images to a web page. This was conceptually quite confusing and required a lot of mind mapping! </p>

<p>Day 17: Once we had understood the task and how to implement the separate steps, we set to work dividing up the task and researching all that was required to build our web app.  By the end of the day it was clear to all that this task would not be easy…</p>

<p>Day 18: Mild, mid-week success. We were successful in pulling tweets from twitter with the hashtag foundersandcoders and filtering these results to push back just images. The next challenge was linking this to the front end.</p>

<p>Day 19: Started playing around with Heroku today. The idea was that we would host our backend node.js as a Heroku app and then link it to our GitHub repository. I was able to host a test app on the Heroku site but we had no luck linking our actual node.js code. </p>

<p>Day 20: Still no luck linking front end with back end and hosting the app on Heroku…the week ended on a all time low ☹ .

										<p>Day 16: For the start of Week Four we began to put the node.js skills we had learnt in the previous week to good use. Refining the back-end code that enabled us to access to the Twitter API and extract data marked the first half of the day, while the second saw us narrow our data fetching to only the image urls. Individually, a great part of my day was also spent re-working the back-end code to our website to incorporate Jekyll. Although this had not been necessary while our site was relatively small-scale and simple, as it grew a content management system became an essential requirement.   </p>

<p>Day 17: On Day Seventeen we decided to, since converting our existing pages to Jekyll had become a messy job, use it as an opportunity to design our whole blog. This meant that we brought in a whole new sleeker design concept that was much less reliant on the Twitter Bootstrap we had used in week one. </p>

<p>Day 18: We struggled to get to grips with what had been out hardest project to date. While our group had excelled during the largely front-end tasks we did not have the same confidence for the back-end part of the projects.</p>

<p>Day 19:Although the task was enjoyable it was clear by Day Nineteen that we were not proficient enough in node to complete the challenge.  </p>

<p>Day 20: The end of Week Four was tough as we did not manage to finish the task. However we picked ourselves up and used the skills that we had managed to pick up in practice in later weeks.

										<p>Day 21: Really excited about this weeks challenge. Robin Houston from kiln came in to present the weekly challenge: creating an interactive map of the world that displayed the price of cocaine for each country, wholesale and retail! We spent most of the day getting to grips with d3, a javascript library used for displaying data interactively. We also followed a fantastic tutorial by Mike Bostock about how to create a map of the British isles. </p>

<p>Day 22: We applied what we had learnt from the tutorial yesterday to build our map of the world using geo json data. Once our maps were in place we set to work understanding the different functions of d3 and watched some online tutorials which helped with our learning hugely. </p>


<p>Day 23: Today was tasked with integrating the cocaine price data into our index file and creating a colour scale based on how cheap or expensive cocaine was in each country. We successfully managed to integrate the retail prices and create a colour scale but it was challenging to create a function that toggled between the retail and wholesale prices.</p>

<p>Day 24: We worked on creating a mouse over function that displayed the name and data for each country when you hovered over it. By the end of the day we were still having trouble integrating the two sets of data and started by creating two different tabs that would display it differentially. </p>

<p>Day 25: Using the windows.location.hash function we created two buttons which swapped between the two data sets successfully, unfortunately we had some problem with the colour scale as some of the countries with retail data but no wholesale data displayed retail data when the wholesale button was clicked. Overall, the basic functionality was there..

										<p><p>Day 21
	This week we have been tasked with creating an interactive map using D3. In short, its the
	week we learn about how lucrative being a cocaine dealer is. We were given some data from
	Kilin.it on retail and wholesale cocaine prices around the world and our task was to present it 	on a map.</p>
<p>Day 22
	This week was a lot better than the last two. Although still challenging, there are a lot of 
	resources out there to help us such as these youtube tutorials (link). It is also pretty impressive 	to see what you can do with D3. Tuesdays are also the day for our strategy meeting with Dan 	where we give feedback on how he can develop the course both long term and short term. 	One of my many mottos in life is.. If you don't ask you don't get. So, cheekily I asked if we could 	have an extra week on the course and Dan agreed!</p>

<p>Day 23
	Day 3 on the course and the maps coming together but we still have a lot to do. I think this 	week was good for the teams 	morale after last weeks struggle. </p>

<p>Day 24
	Presenting our final product tomorrow, I worked together with Abi from Digital Alchemy to get 	our data showing and the team work paid off!</p>
<p>Day 25
	Today we are presenting to Robin from Kilin it who set us the task. It was great to hear his 	feedback and hear more about what he does, he showed us a project he's working on for the 	guardian. </p></p>
