										<p>Day One: Blind Leading the Blind</p>
			<p>
				Aporia: We started with a set of introductory lectures outlining the course and its background. So far, nothing different from most courses. 

				However, then we were giving the week’s task - to build a website and blog for our group - and a list of tools that might be helpful. Then nothing, no lecture to introduce these tools, or show how to do it. We struggled and it was frustrating, several of the tools, like github/git and nitrous.io are not straightforward to use and finding information that worked for all of us across our different operating systems. The method, that did not become apparent as a method until day 2, left us floundering in the dark for several hours. Coming from University education that followed a set formula of lecture, seminar, and then essay or exam on what was taught in the previous lectures - this was drastic change. Slowly and in small jerks, one person in the room or group would find out how to do one thing and others would crowd round to learn, whereby the new knowledge spread throughout the class. Still, I left the first day frustrated and feeling that even the extensive pre-course prerequisite courses had left my woefully unprepared for the actualities of coding. 
				</p>
Day Two: We Made a (bad) Website!4>	
				<p>
				Light dawns: I arrived expecting more of the same confusion as reigned yesterday, but together we began to use Github and our HTML skills to build a basic website. The mood in the group and class room was completely different, we still did not know much about coding besides the basics, but I felt positive about the prospect of figuring our the workings of these tools as a group. I will write more about what I think is so valuable about the teaching approach of throwing the students in at the deep end, once I have more experience with it. At the end of the day we built a basic, but working website in HTML and hosted it on the GitHub pages. 
				</p>
Day Three: Jekyll and Hyde
					<p>
					Bootstrappers get bootstrapping: Wednesday was another very productive day. Olivia found some excellent Bootstrap tutorials that gave us a foothold in that area and I felt we progressed from a very basic site to a much nice looking responsive site over the course of the day. The group vernacular, and particularly my own, had changed as well, from “erhhh, git what?” to “Yeah, just add a metatag, link to the bootstrap cdn and then git commit and push”  
					</p>				
Day Four: Hyd-ing Jekyll
				<p>	
				Jekyll appears: By the end of Wednesday we had built the individual pages of our website and made them nice-looking, but we struggled to find a way of combining the different pages into a single webpage where the pages linked to each other. I fell into the trap of comfort. I felt happy about finding a tool - bootstrap - that was straightforward to use and produced nice-looking results; so I hoped to be able to build the site without using other, as of yet unknown tools. Turns out that isn’t possible. The other groups had started with Jekyll, whilst we started on bootstrap. We got nice layout, whilst they built structured sites. Learning from other groups was a great help and really helped. Most of the day was spent learning this tool, but we started to make the site come together by the end of the day. There was a period where the level of confusion was approaching the first day’s, but because the other groups had spent time on Jekyll before us, we were able to break through this plateau much quicker than on day one. 
				 </p>
Day Five: Lets get this Show on the Road

				<p>
				Showdown: Final day of our first project. Everyone was very positive and hard at work on finishing the project in time for the afternoon presentation. I struggled with building a carousel to display snapshots of the different stages of our projects for our portfolio, which sadly I have  to give up to finish up the interlinking of our different pages on the live page. I am amazed at how far we have come in this week. I feel that building this site would not have been possible with a traditional teacher-led course. The constant social pressure and responsibility of team roles and focus on self and group reliance in solving project problems created a very productive environment, that though frustrating, was successful.

										<p>Day One: Blind Leading the Blind
					<p>Sat here wondering how on earth I will get through the next 7-weeks and come out the other end being able to fully get my code on. 16 of us sat in a room that seemed to be embodying the term "blind leading the blind."<p>
Day Two: We Made a (bad) Website!	
					<p>
					Our gits were pushing and pulling and ready to commit our code just simply needed to put together some code, bootstraps and jekyll 
					
					By 4pm we had a working blog yay! The group morale is a lot better and I think we are on track for all the boot strapping and jekylling tomorrow.. stay tuned to find out.</p>
Day Three: Jekyll and Hyde
					
					<p>
					I think this is the best thing I could have done before starting a new chapter in life - starting my own business. Not even because of the technical aspects of the course. It's the way this course is developing and shaping mindsets and attitudes.
					1. Don't give up - the amount if times things don't work but you have to keep trying and keep figuring out ways to do it 
						2. No one will tell you what to do - same with your business - figure it out 
						3. Patience patience patience 
						4. Don't reinvent the wheel - people have been coding for years- if you can copy their code do it - Greg from sparroh. People have been setting up businesses for years and there is a lot of best practice out there- learn from the best because somewhere somehow someone has done what you want to do in some shape or form!
						Really, not matter what you want to do next in life, this course is for you!</p>
Day Four: Hyd-ing Jekyll
									
				<p>Your environment dictates your work ethic. 
				If feel like the stupidest in the class, good. It means you can only become better. If you're the cleverest in the class, you are your own benchmark. The environment at founders and coders is that no one wants to give up when faced with a challenge And it's helping me develop the same mindset.
				This is the best place to be as a graduate, wantrepreneur, entrepreneur or anything else</p>

										<p>Day One: Blind Leading the Blind<
			<p>
				Extremely overwhelming but looking back it was a great way to get to see the whole team function in a pressure situation. It felt like going from baby steps into a full sprint. I think it set the tone and since then we’ve really grown as a group. We came up with our team name #getmycodeon and set up the foundations that we’ve been building on ever since.</p>
Day Two: We Made a (bad) Website!	
				<p>
				Managed to construct the skeleton of our blog but lacking the beauty elements of CSS. We divided the topics up and did individual research in order to cover a broad swathe of information. As the Presenter I found it challenging to get to grips with everything the group had accomplished and relay that back to the class. </p>
Day Three: Jekyll and Hyde
					<p>
					Struggling to get to grips with Jekyll we opted to dive headlong into Twitter Bootstrap and found some really great functions that we applied to the site. Having a great deal to offer the class come the presentation, it was on day three that I really began to feel that we were picking up pace and combining our strengths as a team to a single end.  </p>
Day Four: Hyd-ing Jekyll
				<p>
				On Day Four our we maintained the velocity established the day before, surging ahead with progress on the site. Deciding to take a page each, I focused on our Blog’s Social Media page, inserting widgets for Twitter, Instagram and Vine. Although separately our pages looked great, we failed in linking all four together. This meant that although aesthetically our blog looked fantastic, in terms of functionality it was somewhat lacking.</p>
Day Five: Lets get this Show on the Road
				<p>
				After linking our pages in the morning – after a minor adjustment – we set about climbing the Jekyll mountain in front of us. We found, however, that it was a) not as difficult as we had first thought and b) not particularly necessary given that we had already created a functional website. We ended the week on a high looking forward to the next project. </p></p>

										<p>Day One: Blind Leading the Blind
			<p>
				First day at Founders and Coders! We were thrown right in at the deep end and asked to create a blog site by the end of the week! Initially, we were split into teams of four with each member taking on a role for the week, mine being the tutor. Team #GetMyCodeOn was born! Firstly, we had to set up our development (dev) environments and create a repository on github, which would become our blogsite. I spent the rest of the day along with my team members attempting to get to grips with all the commands git pull/git commit etc. After a frustrating day of error line after error line we finally managed to set up an organisation team page on git hub and created our first repository!</p>
Day Two: We Made a (bad) Website!
				<p>I started off the day making myself familiar with the terminal on my laptop and all the different features it could do. Just before lunch, as my role as tutor, I gave a quick demo of my development environment and some of the exciting features I had discovered on my command line. 
					In the afternoon we began to create the bare bones of our website using HTML and CSS. Once this had been made we became to play around with Twitter Bootstrap, and Jekyll, two front-end frameworks for styling sites.</p>
Day Three: Jekyll and Hyde
					<p>
					I began the day by watching a series of tutorials on twitter bootstrap and working through them to create a more functional and visually appealing site page. Just before lunch I gave a tutorial on how to make a button on your webpage that links to a website (see tutorial here), something I had just learnt that morning! By that afternoon, as a team, we had created five functional pages using twitter bootstrap that looked great! We then began to experiment with Jekyll which proved frustrating, the styling didn't seem to be very compatible with the bootstrap styling we had used and the result wasn't great. </p>
Day Four: Hyd-ing Jekyll
				<p>	
				After struggling with Jekyll some more, I decided to ditch it in favour of twitter bootstrap and just focus on making the pages functional and look nice. I began to play around with some of the features of twitter bootstrap and gave a tutorial on the grid system and the how websites built with twitter bootstrap are scalable so can be viewed on any sized device easily (check it out on your phone!).  Towards the end of the day we began the arduous process of linking our five pages together to create our blog in time for the deadline tomorrow. Try as we might, we were unable to link them together without seeing a 404 error and left in the evening feeling rather dejected. </p>
Day Five: Lets get this Show on the Road

				<p>Poised with a fresh, optimistic attitude we attempted to tackle our linking problem and successfully managed to link our five pages before 10 am! Huzzah! Now that we had a webpage which linked successfully (ish) to the other pages, we were able to focus on the content of the page and add in some new features. I gave a tutorial on using links within a webpage to navigate to different sections and began to build a navigation bar in the blog page. At the end of the first week we had successfully created a functional webpage! Go team #GetmyCodeOn! </p></p>
