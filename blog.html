										<p>Day One: Blind Leading the Blind</p>
			<p>
				Aporia: We started with a set of introductory lectures outlining the course and its background. So far, nothing different from most courses. 

				However, then we were giving the week’s task - to build a website and blog for our group - and a list of tools that might be helpful. Then nothing, no lecture to introduce these tools, or show how to do it. We struggled and it was frustrating, several of the tools, like github/git and nitrous.io are not straightforward to use and finding information that worked for all of us across our different operating systems. The method, that did not become apparent as a method until day 2, left us floundering in the dark for several hours. Coming from University education that followed a set formula of lecture, seminar, and then essay or exam on what was taught in the previous lectures - this was drastic change. Slowly and in small jerks, one person in the room or group would find out how to do one thing and others would crowd round to learn, whereby the new knowledge spread throughout the class. Still, I left the first day frustrated and feeling that even the extensive pre-course prerequisite courses had left my woefully unprepared for the actualities of coding. 
				</p>
Day Two: We Made a (bad) Website!4>	
				<p>
				Light dawns: I arrived expecting more of the same confusion as reigned yesterday, but together we began to use Github and our HTML skills to build a basic website. The mood in the group and class room was completely different, we still did not know much about coding besides the basics, but I felt positive about the prospect of figuring our the workings of these tools as a group. I will write more about what I think is so valuable about the teaching approach of throwing the students in at the deep end, once I have more experience with it. At the end of the day we built a basic, but working website in HTML and hosted it on the GitHub pages. 
				</p>
Day Three: Jekyll and Hyde
					<p>
					Bootstrappers get bootstrapping: Wednesday was another very productive day. Olivia found some excellent Bootstrap tutorials that gave us a foothold in that area and I felt we progressed from a very basic site to a much nice looking responsive site over the course of the day. The group vernacular, and particularly my own, had changed as well, from “erhhh, git what?” to “Yeah, just add a metatag, link to the bootstrap cdn and then git commit and push”  
					</p>				
Day Four: Hyd-ing Jekyll
				<p>	
				Jekyll appears: By the end of Wednesday we had built the individual pages of our website and made them nice-looking, but we struggled to find a way of combining the different pages into a single webpage where the pages linked to each other. I fell into the trap of comfort. I felt happy about finding a tool - bootstrap - that was straightforward to use and produced nice-looking results; so I hoped to be able to build the site without using other, as of yet unknown tools. Turns out that isn’t possible. The other groups had started with Jekyll, whilst we started on bootstrap. We got nice layout, whilst they built structured sites. Learning from other groups was a great help and really helped. Most of the day was spent learning this tool, but we started to make the site come together by the end of the day. There was a period where the level of confusion was approaching the first day’s, but because the other groups had spent time on Jekyll before us, we were able to break through this plateau much quicker than on day one. 
				 </p>
Day Five: Lets get this Show on the Road

				<p>
				Showdown: Final day of our first project. Everyone was very positive and hard at work on finishing the project in time for the afternoon presentation. I struggled with building a carousel to display snapshots of the different stages of our projects for our portfolio, which sadly I have  to give up to finish up the interlinking of our different pages on the live page. I am amazed at how far we have come in this week. I feel that building this site would not have been possible with a traditional teacher-led course. The constant social pressure and responsibility of team roles and focus on self and group reliance in solving project problems created a very productive environment, that though frustrating, was successful.

										<p>Day One: Blind Leading the Blind
					<p>Sat here wondering how on earth I will get through the next 7-weeks and come out the other end being able to fully get my code on. 16 of us sat in a room that seemed to be embodying the term "blind leading the blind."<p>
Day Two: We Made a (bad) Website!	
					<p>
					Our gits were pushing and pulling and ready to commit our code just simply needed to put together some code, bootstraps and jekyll 
					
					By 4pm we had a working blog yay! The group morale is a lot better and I think we are on track for all the boot strapping and jekylling tomorrow.. stay tuned to find out.</p>
Day Three: Jekyll and Hyde
					
					<p>
					I think this is the best thing I could have done before starting a new chapter in life - starting my own business. Not even because of the technical aspects of the course. It's the way this course is developing and shaping mindsets and attitudes.
					1. Don't give up - the amount if times things don't work but you have to keep trying and keep figuring out ways to do it 
						2. No one will tell you what to do - same with your business - figure it out 
						3. Patience patience patience 
						4. Don't reinvent the wheel - people have been coding for years- if you can copy their code do it - Greg from sparroh. People have been setting up businesses for years and there is a lot of best practice out there- learn from the best because somewhere somehow someone has done what you want to do in some shape or form!
						Really, not matter what you want to do next in life, this course is for you!</p>
Day Four: Hyd-ing Jekyll
									
				<p>Your environment dictates your work ethic. 
				If feel like the stupidest in the class, good. It means you can only become better. If you're the cleverest in the class, you are your own benchmark. The environment at founders and coders is that no one wants to give up when faced with a challenge And it's helping me develop the same mindset.
				This is the best place to be as a graduate, wantrepreneur, entrepreneur or anything else</p>

										<p>Day One: Blind Leading the Blind<
			<p>
				Extremely overwhelming but looking back it was a great way to get to see the whole team function in a pressure situation. It felt like going from baby steps into a full sprint. I think it set the tone and since then we’ve really grown as a group. We came up with our team name #getmycodeon and set up the foundations that we’ve been building on ever since.</p>
Day Two: We Made a (bad) Website!	
				<p>
				Managed to construct the skeleton of our blog but lacking the beauty elements of CSS. We divided the topics up and did individual research in order to cover a broad swathe of information. As the Presenter I found it challenging to get to grips with everything the group had accomplished and relay that back to the class. </p>
Day Three: Jekyll and Hyde
					<p>
					Struggling to get to grips with Jekyll we opted to dive headlong into Twitter Bootstrap and found some really great functions that we applied to the site. Having a great deal to offer the class come the presentation, it was on day three that I really began to feel that we were picking up pace and combining our strengths as a team to a single end.  </p>
Day Four: Hyd-ing Jekyll
				<p>
				On Day Four our we maintained the velocity established the day before, surging ahead with progress on the site. Deciding to take a page each, I focused on our Blog’s Social Media page, inserting widgets for Twitter, Instagram and Vine. Although separately our pages looked great, we failed in linking all four together. This meant that although aesthetically our blog looked fantastic, in terms of functionality it was somewhat lacking.</p>
Day Five: Lets get this Show on the Road
				<p>
				After linking our pages in the morning – after a minor adjustment – we set about climbing the Jekyll mountain in front of us. We found, however, that it was a) not as difficult as we had first thought and b) not particularly necessary given that we had already created a functional website. We ended the week on a high looking forward to the next project. </p></p>

										<p>Day One: Blind Leading the Blind
			<p>
				First day at Founders and Coders! We were thrown right in at the deep end and asked to create a blog site by the end of the week! Initially, we were split into teams of four with each member taking on a role for the week, mine being the tutor. Team #GetMyCodeOn was born! Firstly, we had to set up our development (dev) environments and create a repository on github, which would become our blogsite. I spent the rest of the day along with my team members attempting to get to grips with all the commands git pull/git commit etc. After a frustrating day of error line after error line we finally managed to set up an organisation team page on git hub and created our first repository!</p>
Day Two: We Made a (bad) Website!
				<p>I started off the day making myself familiar with the terminal on my laptop and all the different features it could do. Just before lunch, as my role as tutor, I gave a quick demo of my development environment and some of the exciting features I had discovered on my command line. 
					In the afternoon we began to create the bare bones of our website using HTML and CSS. Once this had been made we became to play around with Twitter Bootstrap, and Jekyll, two front-end frameworks for styling sites.</p>
Day Three: Jekyll and Hyde
					<p>
					I began the day by watching a series of tutorials on twitter bootstrap and working through them to create a more functional and visually appealing site page. Just before lunch I gave a tutorial on how to make a button on your webpage that links to a website (see tutorial here), something I had just learnt that morning! By that afternoon, as a team, we had created five functional pages using twitter bootstrap that looked great! We then began to experiment with Jekyll which proved frustrating, the styling didn't seem to be very compatible with the bootstrap styling we had used and the result wasn't great. </p>
Day Four: Hyd-ing Jekyll
				<p>	
				After struggling with Jekyll some more, I decided to ditch it in favour of twitter bootstrap and just focus on making the pages functional and look nice. I began to play around with some of the features of twitter bootstrap and gave a tutorial on the grid system and the how websites built with twitter bootstrap are scalable so can be viewed on any sized device easily (check it out on your phone!).  Towards the end of the day we began the arduous process of linking our five pages together to create our blog in time for the deadline tomorrow. Try as we might, we were unable to link them together without seeing a 404 error and left in the evening feeling rather dejected. </p>
Day Five: Lets get this Show on the Road

				<p>Poised with a fresh, optimistic attitude we attempted to tackle our linking problem and successfully managed to link our five pages before 10 am! Huzzah! Now that we had a webpage which linked successfully (ish) to the other pages, we were able to focus on the content of the page and add in some new features. I gave a tutorial on using links within a webpage to navigate to different sections and began to build a navigation bar in the blog page. At the end of the first week we had successfully created a functional webpage! Go team #GetmyCodeOn! </p></p>

										Day Six: Client Side Developer Challenge</a></h4>
					<p>
					Confidence: Today started in the opposite way to last week: we were given the challenge to build a widget that would pull content from the Guardian API and display the results from Football, UK News, and Travel in different tabs. The brief included building the site responsive and mobile first. I felt extremely confident about this brief and we got started quickly on building the basic layout. Very confidently I predicted we would be finished by Wednesday, well in advance of the code assessment by the Guardian’s Stephan Fowler. 

					</p>
Day Seven: AJAX/JSON/JSONP/API/JS
				<p>
				Hubris: Yep, wildly underestimated the difficulty of the task. As the morning progressed and none of us had found a way of pulling content from the Guardian API - the core of our project - and no clear way to progress, the confusion of week 1 entered into week 2. It appeared to me as though all the other groups had figured it out and I felt horribly behind. However, after meeting the other project managers it became clear that the other groups were in a similar position to us. We spent most of the day blindly searching for tutorials and guides on google. 

				</p>
Day Eight: DNRY

				<p>
				Steal, then understand: Today was a revelation in that we found a solution to the data fetching problem. Jack was great at implementing and tweaking it to our needs. I got too caught up in the other tasks instead of sitting down and properly understanding how the AJAX called actually work. This was a hinderance in our code evaluations and going forward I will strive to always understand all of our code when we implement it and not later.  
				</p>
Day Nine: Show Time!
				<p>
				Judgement Day: Our big day is here, at five Stephan Fowler of the Guardian is coming to asses our widget. We have the functionality working, but it looks terrible. At two, we find out that our tabs, written in CSS3 does not work in IE9 - which the brief states the widget has to be compatible with. Until the presentation we work at full blast to get the MVP ready. 
				</p>
Day Ten: Minor Tweaks</a></h4>
				<p>Putting the house in order: I feel relaxed today, the presentation went well yesterday. I spend most of the day tidying up our backlog on Pivotal tracker and setting down with the group going through our code, line by line. The mood is good and we get to know each other better over pizza in the garden, courtesy of the first official GetMyCodeOn expedition to the outside world! The sunshine hurt our eyes and harmed our progressing developer complexions after two weeks in our coding lair.

										<p>Day Six: Client Side Developer Challenge
					<p>
					Client side developer challenge this week! This week I am the presenter aka. the project managers right hand woman. Its my role to ensure that we have some sort of working code by 4pm everyday to present back to the rest of the class. Today was a day of googling all the terms that we were unfamiliar with in our brief, AJAX, asynchronous data fetching, JSON..?  We began to develop an idea of what we would be doing but how we would be doing it would take another days work… 

					</p>
Day Seven: AJAX/JSON/JSONP/API/JS
				<p>
					The team tried to work through how to write the code to meet the brief. A good thing about this course is that everyone is up for helping everyone. We roped in other teams to help us understand more about how to approach the task and by the end of the day had working code to present. 

				</p>
Day Eight: DNRY

				<p>
				Crunch time was getting closer - Stephan Fowler will be coming in tomorrow to review each teams work. I could feel the added layer of stress in the room as we were working to an external deadline. 
				</p>
Day Nine: Show Time! 
				<p>
				Stephan would be coming at 5! We spent the day refining our code and making sure that we were adhering to the style guide. I worked on trying to get to grips with all the code so I would be able to present it back. We were the first team up and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. In Stephans words "I have very little to critique." The feedback across all teams was very positive and we all felt proud presenting our final work.
				</p>
Day Ten: Minor Tweaks
				<p>Wrap up - This week was a lot harder than the last, It was a lot more technical and less design work. I struggled a lot however, it was good to see everyone coming together to solve the problem. 

				We created a widget which sourced data from the Guardians website for News, Travel and Sport using an application programming interface. We made a desktop version which was also mobile compatible and began to think about progressive enhancement and graceful degradation when creating applications.</p>

										<p>Day Six: Client Side Developer Challenge
					<p>
					Starting a new week and changing roles within the group, I became the Tutor. Our new project was to create a tabs page for The Guardian that would be a client-side, mobile-first development. I attempted to teach the class about the difference between synchronous and asynchronous data fetching, and although it was by no means a comprehensive overview I think that it was a valuable lesson in the basics of the asynchronous method of data collecting that would form the basis of Week Two’s task.</p>
Day Seven: AJAX/JSON/JSONP/API/JS
				<p>
				Dividing the work by gender and brand of laptop Aske and I tackled the problem of fetching data from The Guardian’s API. Looking back it seemed like an impossible task, however we tackled it head on now our tabs function works really well. Admittedly we did have some help from other groups, most notably Digital Alchemy, however the fact that we can all understand and use API’s is testament to the student led approach of Founders and Coders.</p>
Day Eight: DNRY
				<p>
				We attempted to design the tabs in HTML is order to achieve graceful degradation for those users with ‘lesser’ browsers which did not support the JavaScript we used to pull from the API. We managed to fetch a very basic string of data from The Guardian website on the morning of Day Eight, and by the afternoon had also managed to gain access to the trail text, images and short Urls. We did not, however, manage to organise this data in an aesthetically pleasing way. </p>
Day Nine: Show Time! 
				<p>
				Day Nine was the day of our big review and so in the hours before our presentation to Stephen Fowler at 17:00 we were engaged in a mad whirlwind of activity. Tidying up our code and tweaking our tabs and images took us right up to the wire, but we managed to get everything finished in time and were first to present. AND IT WENT DOWN A TREAT!!! Although perhaps we received an unfair amount of praise due to presenting first, it was agreed that we had fulfilled all of the criteria of the brief and perhaps you will see team #getmycodeon working with The Guardian’s front-end developer team at some point in the future!</p>
Day Ten: Minor Tweaks
				<p>
				The end of our second week was a relaxing one as, having successfully presented our work the day before, we spent our time ironing out the creases and working on Stephens recommendations. As one of the Tutors I presented to the class an idea for establishing a class-wide code convention. I thought this would make reviewing and using each others’ code an easier task.

										<p>Day Six: Client Side Developer Challenge
					<p>To start off the second week we were given the challenge of creating a mobile-first app that pulls the latest news from the Guardian website asynchronously from the Guardian API. The day kicked off with an en-mass google search of APIs and asynchronous data fetching…by lunch, the concept appeared to make sense in our minds but the problem arose with how we were actually going to create code that did what we wanted to do! As we were all relatively unfamiliar with javascript it felt like a tall order. 

					For my role as journalist this week I began playing around with vine and instagram to document our progress...
							</p>
Day Seven: AJAX/JSON/JSONP/API/JS
				<p>
				The day began again with yet more Internet searching for tutorials on a wide variety of confusing acronyms. AJAX, JSON and JSONP were the words 'du jour' but I was none the wiser as to what they actually meant, stood for or how they could be used to fetch our content. 

				By lunch, other teams appeared to have created a piece of code that could fetch data in the way we wanted so after a bit of shameless plagiarisation we finished the day with basic functioning code that could pull the latest content on news, football and travel and input them into three separately labelled tabs. 
				</p>
Day Eight: DNRY
			<p>
			As the task was to create a mobile first component, we focused on shortening the javascript code based on a further acronym DNRY-Do Not Repeat Yourself! We also worked on creating an attractive tabbed layout using javascript and also using the noscript code to flash up a warning message if the did does not have javascript enabled. </p>
Day Nine: Show Time! 
				<p>
				By the end of the day our app was to be scrutinised by Stephen Fowler of the Guardian! Most of the day was focused on creating the most succinct javascript code possible and creating a functioning mobile-first app that looked good on a phone and ran quickly. Things got a bit hectic but there was still time to make a quick vine introducing team #getmycodeon and we finally got our website up and running on our domain name. 
				</p>
Day Ten: Minor Tweaks
				<p>The feedback from Stephen Fowler was really positive and with only a few changes to make we got to work in the morning to create our final product! 
				It had been a technically very challenging week with a large amount of javascript fundamentals to cover but together as a team we pulled together to learn a really useful bit of code!

										<p>Day 11 - Changing approach
					<p>
					Monday started as usual with a presentation on the week’s program by Dan, followed by a briefing on this week’s challenge. At first glance it seemed very similar to the previous week’s challenge, but once we divided the topic up into research areas and reported back to the group the scope and level of difficulty became apparent. As a group we broke down the task, as much as we could, and decided to spend the day studying node.js. Later in the day, we decided as a class to spend the first part of the week, working our way through Nodeschool. 
					</p>
Day 12 - Tough going
				<p>
				I feel that the level of difficulty in the nodeschool exercises jumps very steeply after the first couple of exercises. I wish I had a stronger foundation in javascript. Working with different people across the groups helps, but today is tough going. 

				</p>
Day 13 - Learnyounode</a></h4>

				<p>
				Now we follow a more scheduled traditional approach, to finish the learnyounode/nodeschool exercises. Dan has set times for completion of each exercise and once the time is up, someone will be picked at random to present, followed by Q&A by the rest of the class. I miss the dynamism of working on a project and spend a lot of time finding additional resources that will conceptually explain what the learnyounode exercises require. I have a breakthrough at the end of the day, when a good part of the node exercises make a lot more sense. Talking other people through every line of code, as other groups have done, proved very helpful to consolidate and clarify the learning. 
  
				</p>
Day 14 - The damned sixes
				
				<p>
				I spent almost the entire day on exercise 6, Dan has helpfully given us tips on how to approach it, but I still have not solved it. Once we work through, it all makes sense, but miss having a book to refer to with questions and methods. 

				</p>
Day 15 - Nodeschool out
				<p>
				We finish the last of the learnyounode exercises and return to planning the Twitter API project. I spend the afternoon looking for a solution to hosting and avoiding sharing our API keys on public repositories. Hosting on Heroku and hiding the keys using config variables looks like the way forward. It’s been a long week, but I feel confident that with some added work and reading over the weekend it will have been productive.

										<p>Day 11 - Changing approach
					<p>
					After not being able to attempt the weekend homework on node school I came in on Monday somewhat confuse and disheartened. However, the whole class felt the same so it made things a bit better. We spent the day trying to go through the exercises in node school as a class however it was still yet to make sense to me. The hardest part was trying to discipline yourself mentally to keep trying even though you can't understand what is going on and everyone seems to be ovine forward.
					</p>
Day 12 - Tough going
				<p>
				Today there seemed to be a natural progression for some however for me and other members it still made no sense. Again it was hard to maintain focus as I still had not got to grips with what we were doing yesterday. But Dan assured us that we will all make it to the end! 

				He also did say that this week would be the hardest week which bought some relief, kind of.
				</p>
Day 13 - Learnyounode

				<p>
				Still feeling lost and some what demotivated me and Jack teamed together to start again from the start. We were very behind (a whole two days behind), but it didn't make sense to carry on blindly. I felt like that 'special' child in the class who needed extra assistance. 

				Dan still assured us we will make it!  
				</p>
Day 14 - The damned sixes
				<p>
				Me and Jack were still behind but decided to join the rest of the class again. We were on a tight schedule with hourly slots to work on each problem and then Dan would pick a name out the hat to present the problem. Things started to make sense and it was very endearing to see how we were all working together to explain the content, filling in the gaps of each other and making sure everyone was on the same page.

				</p>
Day 15 - Nodeschool out
				<p>
				It finally makes sense, kind of! After a painful week of node school things started to click. We worked through the rest of the node school exercises. I found myself being able to explain some of the stuff that we had been going through, I didn't even know I knew it! I guess something had been going in this last week. 

				This week was a week of frustration to say the least. Words from Dan - Part of being a developer is being able to work through the feeling of "I'm dumb I don't get it." That was definitely the feeling of this week. More then ever this course is developing mental resilience when faced with challenges!</p></p>
